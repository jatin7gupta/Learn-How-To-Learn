      "content": "There are few institutions in the world that evoke as strong of a reaction as Goldman Sachs.\nTo the broader public, their name is synonymous with Wall Street and the mortgage crisis that led to the great recession of 2007–2008. The prestige that was previously associated with their brand become the vehicle of recognition that later brought on widespread criticism.\nThere was, however, a time in history when they weren’t the giants that they are today. In fact, in the early 20th century, they were a mid-tier trading firm with a quiet reputation.\nThe name Sidney Weinberg may not ring too many bells today, but in his time, he was a man that commanded great respect. Fortune Magazine called him the “Director’s Director,” and he’s credited with being the force that turned a struggling bank into a lasting institution.\nWeinberg has a classic rags-to-riches story. He began his foray into the world of finance as a janitor’s assistant making $3 a week. He left at the top.\nRegardless of how you feel about Goldman Sachs, there is quite an interesting story here, and it sheds insight into the process behind breakout results",

      "content": "The following is reformatted from a presentation I gave at LinkedIn last year.\nThe presentation attempted to explain functional programming without using concepts like “monads” or “immutability” or “side effects”. Instead it focuses on how thinking about composition can make you a better programmer, regardless of what language you use.\n40 years ago, on October 17th, 1977, the Turing Award was presented to John Backus for his contribution to the design of high-level programming systems, most notably the Fortran programming language. All Turing Award winners are given the opportunity to present a lecture on a topic of their choice during the year in which they receive the award. As the creator of the Fortran programming language, one may have expected Backus to lecture on the benefits of Fortran and future developments in the language. Instead, he gave a lecture entitled Can programming be liberated from the Von Neumann style? in which he criticized some of the mainstream languages of the day, including Fortran, for their shortcomings. He also proposed an alternative: a functional style of programming.\n\nThe lecture contrasts conventional programs and their “inability to effectively use powerful combining forms” with functional programs which are “founded on the use of combining forms.” Functional programming has received renewed interest in the past several years due to the rise of highly scalable and parallel computing. But the main benefit of functional programming is one that can be realized regardless of if your program is going to be parallelized or not: functional programming is better at composition.\nComposition is the ability to assemble complex behavior by aggregating simple pieces. In computer science classes much emphasis is put on abstraction: taking a large problem and splitting it up into tractable pieces. Less emphasis is put on the reverse: once you have the small pieces implemented then how do you connect them together. It seems that some functions and systems are easy to connect together whereas others are much messier. But we need to take a step back and ask: what properties of these functions and systems make them easy to compose? What properties make them hard to compose? After you’ve read through enough code the pattern starts to emerge, and this pattern is the key to understanding functional programming.\n",

Anobit Braeburn Capital Beats Electronics Apple Energy, LLC Apple Sales International[4]\nWebsite\tapple.com\nApple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's consumer software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.\nApple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, saw significant momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created his own company. As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the Microsoft Windows operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail stores in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics and announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.\nApple is the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung. In February 2015, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over US$700 billion. The company employs 123,000 full-time employees as of September 2017 and maintains 498 retail stores in 22 countries as of July 2017. It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. As of January 2016, more than one billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.\nApple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $229 billion for the 2017 fiscal year. The company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty and has been repeatedly ranked as the world's most valuable brand. However, it receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors and its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.",
